# Linux File Permissions

## What it is
Linux uses file permissions to control who can read, write, or execute files.

## Why it matters in security
Incorrect permissions can allow attackers to access sensitive files or execute malicious scripts.

## Commands Used
- ls -l
- chmod
- chown
- whoami
- id

## What I Practiced
I checked file permissions and modified them to restrict access.

## How attackers abuse this
Attackers exploit misconfigured permissions to escalate privileges or read sensitive data.

## How to defend
- Use least privilege
- Regular permission audits
