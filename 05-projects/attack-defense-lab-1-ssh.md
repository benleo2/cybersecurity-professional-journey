# Attack–Defense Lab 1: SSH Exposure

## Objective
Analyze SSH exposure and apply defensive controls.

## Environment
- Attacker: Kali Linux
- Target: Metasploitable2

## Attack Phase
- Port scanning identified SSH exposure

## Evidence Observed
- Authentication logs showed SSH activity

## Defense Phase
- Firewall restrictions applied
- Reduced exposed services

## Result
- Attack surface minimized

## Lessons Learned
Exposure matters more than exploitation.
