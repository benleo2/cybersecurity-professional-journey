# TryHackMe – Intro to Offensive Security

## Objective
Understand how attackers identify exposed services and why exposure matters.

## What I Did
- Connected to a controlled lab environment
- Identified exposed services on the target
- Learned how attackers enumerate systems

## What I Observed
- Open services reveal attack surface
- Enumeration is the first step in any attack

## Defensive Insight
- Minimize exposed services
- Use firewalls and access controls
- Monitor logs for scanning activity

## Lessons Learned
Attacks begin with exposure analysis, not exploitation.
