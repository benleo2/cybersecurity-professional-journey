# Network Ports & Services

## What it is
Ports allow services to communicate over a network.

## Why it matters in security
Each open port increases the attack surface.

## Commands Used
- ss
- netstat
- ip
- nmap

## Hands-on Practice
- Identified listening ports
- Mapped services to ports
- Compared local vs network exposure

## Attacker Perspective
Attackers scan ports to find exposed services.

## Defender Perspective
Defenders close unused ports and restrict access.
