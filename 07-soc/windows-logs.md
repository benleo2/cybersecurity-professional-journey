# Windows Logs – Security Events

## What I Studied
Windows Security logs and authentication-related events.

## Important Event IDs
- 4624: Successful login
- 4625: Failed login
- 4688: Process creation

## Hands-on Practice
Filtered failed login events and analyzed source IPs and timestamps.

## SOC Insight
Repeated failed logins can indicate brute-force attacks.
