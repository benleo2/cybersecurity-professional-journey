# Web Server Logs – Attack Detection

## What I Studied
Apache/Nginx access and error logs.

## Log Structure
- Client IP
- Request method
- URL and parameters
- Status codes

## Attack Indicators
- SQL Injection patterns
- XSS payloads
- Scanning behavior

## Hands-on Practice
Analyzed access logs and searched for suspicious requests.

## SOC Insight
Web attacks can be detected through careful log analysis.
