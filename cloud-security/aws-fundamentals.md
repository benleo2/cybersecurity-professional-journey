# AWS Fundamentals – Security Perspective

## What AWS Is
AWS provides cloud infrastructure services such as compute, storage, and networking.

## Shared Responsibility Model
AWS secures the infrastructure; customers secure configurations, access, and data.

## Why Cloud Security Matters
Misconfigurations are the leading cause of cloud breaches.

## Security Insight
Identity and access management is the new security perimeter in cloud environments.

## AWS Global Infrastructure

### Regions
Regions determine data residency, compliance, and latency.

### Availability Zones
AZs provide isolation and resilience but do not prevent misconfigurations.

### Edge Locations
Edge locations help mitigate DDoS and protect origin services.

## Security Insight
Infrastructure resilience does not replace proper access control.

## Core AWS Services – Security View

### EC2
Requires OS hardening, restricted network access, and key protection.

### S3
Improper permissions can lead to major data leaks.

## IAM Fundamentals

IAM controls identity and permissions in AWS.

### Components
- Users
- Groups
- Roles
- Policies

### Security Risks
Over-permissive policies and lack of MFA cause most cloud breaches.

### Security Insight
Identity is the primary security boundary in cloud environments.


### VPC
Network segmentation reduces attack blast radius.

## Security Insight
Cloud services are powerful but dangerous when misconfigured.
