IAM policies define Effect, Action, Resource, and Condition.

## Allow vs Deny
Explicit deny always overrides allow.

## Least Privilege
Permissions should be scoped to exact resources and actions.

## Conditions
Conditions enforce security controls like MFA and IP restrictions.

## Security Insight
Over-permissive policies are a major cloud security risk.
